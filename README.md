# Port Scanner

This is a simple Python-based port scanner that helps identify open ports on a remote server. The tool checks if a given set of ports (e.g., 80, 443) are open and prints the result. It's useful for network security assessments.

## How to Use
- Run the script.
- Enter the target host and the port range you want to scan.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## How to Run
```bash
python port_scanner.py
